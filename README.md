# The Sass 1 color experiment

This project aims to explore the sass (in future maybye also Compass) color functions by using only one fixed color definition (primary color). All other colors are based on this main color.

## Process Sass
cd styles/

sh watch.sh

## Update html5boilerplate / inuitcss
git pull -s subtree html5boilerplate master

git pull -s subtree inuitcss master
